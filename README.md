 # Technical Details

React and JavaScript

React: The Music App is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React enables us to create reusable UI components, manage application state effectively, and build a performant and responsive user interface.

React Router: Used for navigation within the app, allowing users to switch between different views such as Home, Search, Library, and Profile without reloading the page.

Redux: Utilized for state management to ensure a consistent and predictable application state across different components. Redux helps in managing user authentication, playlist data, and music playback state.

Axios: A promise-based HTTP client used to make API requests to the backend server. Axios helps in fetching music data, handling user authentication, and managing other server interactions.
